            <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-using-utm-parameters/">UTM (Urchin Tracking Module)</a> parameters are short strings of text that you can add to a URL in order to track the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns across traffic sources and publishing media.
